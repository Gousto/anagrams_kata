# Anagrams kata

Welcome to the anagrams kata coding challenge!

## The challenge

Given a file `words.json` containing set of words, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams. Each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams of each other. Example outout of your program:

```
  kinship pinkish
  enlist inlets listen silent
  boaster boaters borates
  fresher refresh
  sinks skins
```

## The rules

1. Approach this problem any way you like, use any language/library/framwork you see fit
2. You will not be judged on whether you finish or not. We would much rather you give us a solution you are proud of and feel best dusplays the type of code you want to ship to production.
